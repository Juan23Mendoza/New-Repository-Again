  <p>This website is dedicated to the fact that I want to be able to convince my mom to let me purchase a vehicle that requires an internal combustion engine in between my legs to get me from Point A to Point B, so in simple terms, a motorcycle</p>
    <p>On this website, you will find the information I have scoured the internet for in order to convince my mom to let me drive a motorcycle </p>
    <p>If you also need to convince your mom and/or dad to get a motorcycle, feel free to use this website as a reference </p>
